            </div>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been keeping my eye out for interesting CTF&rsquo;s to compete in. This past weekend, the corCTF team hosted their own event and boy was it a tough one. Being primarily a forensics guy, I was definitely out of my comfort zone with many of the challenges being binary exploitation, reversing, and cryptography. I clung onto anything that looked familiar and in the end was able to crack a web challenge for a few points.]]></description>

Lucky for me, GuidePoint Security recently ran their August iteration and it gave me a chance to brush off some cobwebs! I wasn&rsquo;t able to solve all the challenges (damn you Python!) but had a pretty good idea on how to approach most of &lsquo;em. Below are some write-ups on ones that I had fun trying to solve.]]></description>
